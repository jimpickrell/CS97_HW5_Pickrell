CS97 HW 5 Notes

The assignment is located here:
http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter21/cs97-1/assign/assign5.html


Reorganize code

We have a program randall.c and a Makefile to go with it.

First see if it compiles.  I'm doing this on an Ubuntu machine on AWS, and on my Mac at home.

The note in the code says to use the option -mdrnd, so that is what I will do:

The linux command to unpack this is

tar Jxvf file.txz

On the Mac you just double click and it unpacks.

I will try this homework on the Mac first.

I took the original file and marked off the sections for various files:

cpu_check.c	output.c	rand64-hw.c	rand64-sw.c	randall.c
cpu_check.h	output.h	rand64-hw.h	rand64-sw.h	randall.h

I removed the "static" command from the function names, because this prevents linking.

I added the #ifndef #define #endif commands to each h file.

I then compiled each of the c files to make sure they would compile.

Note that the -mrdrnd" option is required to compile rand64-hw.c.  The others don't need it.
Next I compiled and linked the whole project:

$ gcc -mrdrnd *.c

Then I tested it as a.out, which seemed fine.
$ ./a.out
./a.out: usage: ./a.out NBYTES

So far, so good.  Let's build a make file.

Makefile

I created an "all" section in the makefile as follows:

 
all: cpu_check.o output.o rand64-hw.o rand64-sw.o randall.o
   gcc -o randall cpu_check.o output.o rand64-hw.o rand64-sw.o randall.o
 
cpu_check.o: cpu_check.c
   gcc -c cpu_check.c -o cpu_check.o
 
output.o: output.c
   gcc -c output.c -o output.o
 
rand64-hw.o: rand64-hw.c
   gcc -c  -mrdrnd rand64-hw.c -o rand64-hw.o
 
rand64-sw.o: rand64-sw.c
   gcc -c rand64-sw.c -o rand64-sw.o
 
randall.o: randall.c
   gcc -c randall.c -o randall.o

To keep things simple, I explicitly listed filenames and options for the compile.  To keep the 
code compact, I dropped the options that weren't required for compilation.  Each o file is 
recreated any time the corresponding c file is changed.  The project is relinked any time any 
of the o files is changed.  To test this I made a couple of changes to c files and confirmed 
that the project was correctly compiled and linked.

The key code segments that create the tar files follow:

myfiles = \
	options.c options.h \
	randall.c randall.h \
	rand64-hw.c rand64-hw.h \
	rand64-sw.c rand64-sw.h \
	output.c output.h \
	notes.txt \
	MAKEFILE

submission: $(myfiles)
	tar -czf randall-submission.tgz $(myfiles)

gitsubmission: randall-submission.tgz
	tar -czf randall-git.tgz .git



getopt

The spec requests named -i and -o options, as well as n which is positional.  The easiest way t
o do this is with getopt, which is pretty similar to what we used in a previous project in Python.

The options are read with the following code in options.c

   while ((c = getopt(argc, argv, "vi:o:")) != -1) {
        if(s->verbose_output)printf("User selected option %c\n",c);
        (process the options)
        }

The colon after i and o means that these have an argument which follows.

The values are returned to my main routine in a struct called "my_options".  This is initialized 
at program start and then destroyed at program end.


Git archive

The spec requires us to build a git archive.  I created this on github, with an appropriate 
gitignore, then cloned it to my hard disk.

git clone https://github.com/jimpickrell/CS97_HW5_Pickrell.git

I copied all the relevant files like this

git add *
git commit -m "adding files"
git push


Tar archives

These are created in the Makefile with "make submission" and "make gitsubmission" as 
described earlier.


Testing on Linux

I uploaded everything to the main git archive and hten cloned it onto Linux.

Note: my linux computer has the hardware acceleration so you can test without setting input:

./randall 5

The mac doesn't have this so you need to try something like:

./randall -i mrand48_r 7

This forces it to use software generation of the random values.

I made a couple of small changes, then pushed it back to the archive and loaded it back
onto the Mac.  There I tested again and then generated the correct tar files, to upload.
